This is an update for the old plugin "Closed For Maintenance"(https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/maintenance-plugin) made by Adrian Speyer (http://adrianspeyer.com/).
</pre>
<p>When you enable this plugin it will allow you to "close" your forum as you upgrade or make changes. You can customize the image by replacing the current one (maintenance.png).</p>
<p>Now when in Maintenance mode, a bar will show to remind you to turn off the plugin. When you disable the plugin, visitors can access the site again.</p>
<p><b>Note: Be careful not to sign out with the plugin enabled or you have to go back and remove it from the plugins folder to get back in as admin. This is made for someone to upgrade or make small tweaks and reopen the forum.</b></p>
<br />
